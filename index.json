Colorectal cancer (CRC) is not different. In fact, due to its usually slower progression and somehow later detection, it acquires more mutations and manifests higher intra-tumor morphological diversity then some other cancers.\nProject In this project, we investigate the CRC heterogeneity starting with its morphological features. Using the morphology as an anchor for tumor sampling, we explore the diversity of the molecular programs that drive the tumor evolution. We have obtained about 200 expression profiles from over 100 different tumors, representing six different morphotypes (complex tubular, desmoplastic, mucinous, papillary, serrated and solid/trabecular). In addition, we have also profiles tumor-adjacent normal tisse and tumor-associated stroma for building reference profiles.\nMain results The morphology-guided tumor sampling allows for a finer resolution than whole-tumor profiling. On the other hand, the single-cell assays are able to extract very specific profiles from tiny tumor regions however at the cost of losing much of the phenotypical context. The bioinformatics analyses revealed a high degree of variability in gene expression between regions. More importantly, even within the same tumor (same section), we were able to identify differences in major pathways (e.g. MAPK, WNT, TGFb). Since these pathways are fundamental in tumor classification (e.g. by consensus molecular subtypes, or by prognostic signatures), it comes with no suprise that these classifiers vary also across regions, even within the tumor. These results call for a deeper investigation of the impact of intra-tumoral heterogeneity on the molecular-/expression-based decision systems.\n","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643673600,"objectID":"2630345be367c62fd19e0892927c866f","permalink":"https://bioinfo-recetox.github.io/project/gacr2019_vp/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gacr2019_vp/","section":"project","summary":"We investigate the molecular landscape of the morphotypes.","tags":["gacr","cpath","ith","transcriptomics","crc"],"title":"Molecular portraits of major morphological components of colon tumors","type":"project"},{"authors":["Barbora Zwinsová","Vyacheslav A.

We found that the CRC microbiome is strongly correlated with the grade, location and stage, but these associations are dependent on the microbial environment.

The connection between tumor morphology and molecular subtypes has been previously described qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, it has been suggested that variability in tumor sampling strategies would lead to less reproducible subtype classifications. To better understand the sources of heterogeneity and for stabilizing the CMS classifier, we performed a morphology-directed tumor sampling for RNA extraction and compared the predicted CMS with whole-tumor results. We choose to base our sampling on well-established tumor morphologies to improve the interpretability and lower selection variability. **Methods** From 100 colon tumors (hospital cohort), consecutive sections were used for whole-tumor and morphological-region RNA extraction. The following tumor morphological regions have been manually annotated in the virtual slides and macro-dissected: complex tubular, desmoplastic, mucinous, papillary, serrated, and solid trabecular. Additionally, a number of tumor-adjacent normal and stroma regions have been marked. We used the CMScaller package for subtype assignment to both whole tumor and regional profiles, with n=1000 permutations and FDR=25%. **Results** In total, 100 whole tumor and 152 regional transcriptomics profiles were obtained, respectively. No subtype was assigned to 22% and 23% of whole tumor and regional profiles. For whole tumor CMS1-3, there was a good concordance with the subtype assigned to at least one of its corresponding morphological regions (73%, 62% and 78%, respectively). However, CMS4 appeared to be less stable, with only 44% of the regions being CMS4, other 21% being CMS2. In one case, the whole tumor subtype (CMS2) did not correspond to any of the associated regions profiled (complex tubular - CMS1, mucinous - CMS4 and tumor-adjacent normal - CMS3). When considering the subtypes assigned to each morphological region, we observed that: Complex tubular regions were mostly labeled as CMS1 (41%) and CMS2 (32%); Desmoplastic regions were labeled as CMS4 (54%) and CMS1 (31%). In addition, the subtype of the desmoplastic region, when in combination with other region types, determined the whole tumor subtype. Serrated regions were mostly labeled as CMS2 (42%) and CMS3 (32%); All tumor-adjacent stroma was labeled as CMS4. Surprisingly, most of the mucinous regions were assigned to CMS4 (60%). The analysis of subtype molecular markers indicated that canonical Wnt is mostly activated in mucinous, serrated and stroma regions. Also, the EMT signature had highest values in desmoplastic, mucinous and stroma regions. **Conclusions** The morphological regions may have a different molecular subtype than the whole tumor, indicating the presence of additional subtypes. The current gene expression classifiers are sensitive to tumor sampling protocol. Clear specification of region(s) used for RNA profiling is necessary for improving the stability of the molecular subtype classification and multi-region sampling opens the possibility for refining the CMS classification. The CMS4 EMT characteristics are most probably due to the desmoplastic reaction.","tags":["crc","ith","gacr","transcriptomics"],"title":"Consensus molecular subtypes of morphological regions on colorectal tumors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Stenvang","Eva Budinská","Eric van Cutsem","Fred Bosman","Vlad Popovici","Nils Brünner"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1586908800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586908800,"objectID":"281d1b0403ecc5315f244cb82c012051","permalink":"https://bioinfo-recetox.github.io/publication/2020-cancers/","publishdate":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-cancers/","section":"publication","summary":"Biomarker-guided treatment for patients with colon cancer is needed. We tested ABCG2 and topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) mRNA expression as predictive biomarkers for irinotecan benefit in the PETACC-3 patient cohort. The present study included 580 patients with mRNA expression data from Stage III colon cancer samples from the PETACC-3 study, which randomized the patients to Fluorouracil/leucovorin (5FUL) +/− irinotecan. The primary end-points were recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients were divided into one group with high ABCG2 expression (above median) and low TOP-1 expression (below 75 percentile) (“resistant”) (n = 216) and another group including all other combinations of these two genes (“sensitive”) (n = 364). The rationale for the cut-offs were based on the distribution of expression levels in the PETACC-3 Stage II set of patients, where ABCG2 was unimodal and TOP1 was bimodal with a high expression level mode in the top quarter of the patients. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios and the association between variables and end-points and log-rank tests to assess the statistical significance of differences in survival between groups. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival functions were used for visualization and estimation of survival rates at specific time points. Significant differences were found for both RFS (Hazard ratio (HR): 0.63 (0.44–0.92); p = 0.016) and OS (HR: 0.60 (0.39–0.93); p = 0.02) between the two biomarker groups when the patients received FOLFIRI (5FUL+irinotecan). Considering only the Microsatellite Stable (MSS) and Microsatellite Instability-Low (MSI-L) patients (n = 470), the differences were even more pronounced. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the groups when patients received 5FUL alone. This study shows that the combination of ABCG2 and TOP1 gene expression significantly divided the Stage III colon cancer patients into two groups regarding benefit from adjuvant treatment with FOLFIRI but not 5FUL.","tags":["biomarkers","transcriptomics","crc"],"title":"An explorative analysis of ABCG2/TOP-1 mRNA expression as a biomarker test for FOLFIRI treatment in stage III colon cancer patients: results from retrospective analyses of the PETACC-3 trial","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eva Budinská"],"categories":null,"content":"Funding: EU-H2020 (Grant agreement ID: 825410); Principal investigator for MUNI: Eva Budinska\nOverview (from the project’s official website)\nIn view of the world-wide epidemic of cancer, which is linked to environmental and life-style factors, there is an unmet medical need in breakthrough concepts to understand the causes of neoplasia. One possible factor contributing to oncogenesis and tumor progression that has been neglected is the microbiota.\nIndeed, the mammalian phenotype is largely driven by the combination of host and microbial genes. Beyond its role in regulating many fundamental functions of health, the intestinal metagenome appears to be dramatically implicated in cancer initiation, progression as well as responses to therapies, even for cancers developing in sterile tissues outside of the gastrointestinal tract.\nStudies on the gut microbiome have so far been organized on a small and local scale, and there is an urgent need to:\nFully identify and functionally characterize cancer-relevant microbial species by means of robust and standardized methods to validate cancer-associated gut microbiome fingerprints Assess their clinical relevance for patient prognosis Develop diagnostic tools that could become part of the oncological arsenal for the prevention, prediction and personalization of cancer therapy. Project Accumulating evidence underscores the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease, including cancer. The scope of the EU-funded ONCOBIOME project is to identify and functionally characterise the commensal bacteria of high clinical relevance. Using cohorts of more than 3 000 patients with cancer across 10 countries, project partners will identify microbiome signatures related to cancer occurrence, prognosis and response to therapy. They will also investigate the mechanistic interplay with the host metabolism, immunity and oncogenesis. Apart from fundamental knowledge, project results will lead to novel diagnostic and prognostic tests for cancer, as well as tailor-made pre- and pro-biotics.\nObjectives Beyond the role the intestinal metagenome plays in regulating multiple physBeyond its role in regulating multiple physiological functions that impact health, the intestinal metagenome is implicated in cancer initiation, progression and responses to therapies, even for extraintestinal neoplasia. Hence, there is an urgent need to fully identify and functionally characterize minimalist commensal ecosystems relevant to cancer, with reliable and robust methods, to validate cancer-associated gut microbiome fingerprints of high clinical relevance, and to develop diagnosis tools that will become part of the oncological arsenal for the optimization and personalization of therapy. Based on retro-and pro-spective studies, with large discovery and validation cohorts enrolling \u0026gt;9,000 cancer patients across 10 countries, ancillary to ongoing innovative clinical trials or FDA/EMA approvals across 4 frequent cancer types, ONCOBIOME will pursue the following aims: 1/ identify and validate core or cancer-specific Gut OncoMicrobiome Signatures (GOMS) associated with cancer occurrence, prognosis, response to, or progression on, therapy (polychemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, dendritic cell vaccines) or adverse effects, 2/ decipher the functional relevance of these cancer-associated gut commensal ecosystems in the regulation of host metabolism, immunity and oncogenesis, 3/ integrate these GOMS with other oncology hallmarks (clinics, genomics, immunomics, metabolomics) 4/ design optimal companion tests, based on those integrated signatures to predict cancer occurrence and progression. With high carat interdisciplinary experts, ONCOBIOME expects to validate cancer or therapy-specific Gut OncoMicrobiome Signatures (GOMS) across breast, colorectal, melanoma and lung cancers adjusting for covariates, to unravel the mode of action of these GOMS in innovative platforms, thus lending support to the design of cancer preventive campaigns using well characterized pre-and pro-biotics.\n","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"71931033457f99f27216045720d15b19","permalink":"https://bioinfo-recetox.github.io/project/oncobiome/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/oncobiome/","section":"project","summary":"Exploiting the gut microbiome for cancer diagnosis and treatment","tags":["microbiome","horizon","crc","multiomics","biomarkers"],"title":"ONCOBIOME: Gut OncoMicrobiome Signatures associated with cancer incidence, prognosis and prediction of treatment response","type":"project"},{"authors":["Vlad Popovici"],"categories":null,"content":"Funding: AZV (NV19-03-00298); Principal investigator: Vlad Popovici\nPartners: RECETOX - MMCI - CEITEC\nBackground Differences that exist both between and within tumours of the same cancer type are a major hurdle towards proper patient selection for a given treatment and for developing more targeted therapies. Depending on the perspective under which these differences are investigated, different categorisation paradigms have emerged. The systematisation of clinical and histopathological parameters led to the definition of the current TNM staging system which presently constitutes the gold standard for diagnosis and prognosis. At a different scale, the intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) has been a long-time recognised phenomenon, but its tremendous impact on diagnosis and treatment outcome only recently started to be systematically investigated. Experiments such as single-cell or surgical tumour multi-sampling sequencing portrayed a highly heterogeneous picture of the various cancers with trunk and branch driver mutations distributed non-uniformly in time and space. In colon cancer, while KRAS, NRAS and BRAF appear to be trunk driver mutations, TP53 and PIK3CA seem to be branch driver mutations.\nProject The overarching objective of this project is to explore and characterise the impact of ITH on the clinical decisions regarding prognosis (for stage II patients) and personalised treatment (for metastatic patients). Such analyses require a multi-region-based tumour sampling which, inherently, increases the costs of the experiments and may introduce - if not controlled - additional noise in the data due to the particular choices made in selecting the sampling sites. In order to control for these factors we propose to select the sampling regions based on their morphological characteristics, thus a pathologist could relatively easily identify them.\n","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"85822759770fc441ecacfc6544aabd14","permalink":"https://bioinfo-recetox.github.io/project/azv2019_vp/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/azv2019_vp/","section":"project","summary":"Region-based biomarkers.","tags":["azv","crc","ith","biomarkers","multiomics"],"title":"Clinical implications of intra-tumour heterogeneity in colon cancer","type":"project"},{"authors":["Eva Budinská"],"categories":null,"content":"Funding: GACR (GA19-08646S); Principal investigator: Vlad Popovici\nPartners: RECETOX - MMCI\n","date":1454284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454284800,"objectID":"32336c53dd79069218526b00fb49427e","permalink":"https://bioinfo-recetox.github.io/project/azv2016_eb/","publishdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/azv2016_eb/","section":"project","summary":"The aim is to improve prognostic and predictive stratification of CRC by defining microbial-immune-molecular CRC pathophenotypes and correlate them with tumour aggressiveness and patient prognosis.","tags":["azv","microbiome","crc","ith"],"title":"Colobiome: Tumour-adjacent microbiome and immune profile of tumour in the context of heterogeneity and aggressivness of colorectal cancer","type":"project"},{"authors":["Vlad Popovici"],"categories":null,"content":"Funding: EU-FP7 (Grant agreement ID: 602901); Principal investigator for MUNI: Vlad Popovici\nObjective Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common cancer in Europe, and with approximately 200,000 deaths per year, it remains the 2nd most common cause of cancer death. More than half of all CRC patients develop distant metastases and have 5-year overall survival (OS) of less than 5% because of ineffective treatments. Increased understanding of cancer biology, coupled with the implementation of “omics”-based approaches, has revealed that cancer must be considered a heterogeneous disease. Historically, “one-size-fits-all” approaches have been standard practice in CRC treatment, but with the increased understanding of the molecular/genetic heterogeneity of CRC, it is clear that novel treatments must be developed and tested in selected subgroups to maximize the benefit of these new developments. MErCuRIC is a multicentre phase Ia/b clinical trial which will assess a novel therapeutic strategy (combined treatment of a MEK inhibitor PD-0325901 or MEK-162 with a MET inhibitor PF-02341066) to combat metastasis, improve survival and change current clinical practice for CRC patients with RAS mutant (MT) and RAS wild type (WT) (with aberrant c-MET) tumours. The consortium will go beyond the current state-of-the-art by (i) employing a novel treatment strategy targeting the biology of the disease and by (ii) using next generation sequencing (NGS) and ‘xenopatients’ to identify CRC patient subgroups who will maximally benefit from this novel treatment strategy.\nResults The PK analyses found that giving Binimetinib with Crizotinib did not affect the PK of Binimetinib compared to giving Binimetinib alone. A Phase Ib (dose expansion) study was undertaken with Binimetinib and Crizotinib with mCRC patients, with the aim of looking at three sub-groups of mCRC patients expected to respond to the therapy. Interim analyses found no clinical response in one sub-group, though PD results showed evidence of inhibition of the targeted molecular pathways. Recruitment to the remaining two sub-groups proved infeasible due to the rarity of patients.\nSee also Final report\n","date":1367366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1367366400,"objectID":"5cf23ae45cd2ad9c2ad08bcea6f3d28d","permalink":"https://bioinfo-recetox.github.io/project/mercuric/","publishdate":"2013-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mercuric/","section":"project","summary":"Exploiting the gut microbiome for cancer diagnosis and treatment","tags":["horizon","crc","biomarkers"],"title":"A Phase Ia/b study of MEK1/2 inhibitor PD-0325901 or MEK-162 with cMET inhibitor PF-02341066 in RASMT and RASWT (with aberrant c-MET) Colorectal Cancer Patients.","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://bioinfo-recetox.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://bioinfo-recetox.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"https://bioinfo-recetox.github.io/projects/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Vlad Popovici"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5e113ce6bf37296640a6ae47c9bd4c94","permalink":"https://bioinfo-recetox.github.io/downloads/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/downloads/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Downloads","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8e7bc052bdfc6746ea2bb6595e8093eb","permalink":"https://bioinfo-recetox.github.io/home/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/home/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Welcome to IB2","type":"widget_page"}]
